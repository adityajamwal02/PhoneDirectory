# PhoneDirectory

# INTRODUCTION

Our project demonstrates the working of contact number applications and also teach about various data structures. Typically, phone directory management application consists of searching, sorting, inserting and deleting operations.


# OBJECTIVES

The main objective of our project was to develop an application firm that facilitates optimised data maintenance and its retrieval and perform searching, sorting, inserting and deleting operations in an igneous way and developing a user-friendly application that requires minimal user training.

The information contained in the telephone directory records would be name, phone no. and email of the person whose record is entered in the telephone directory application project. So, the simple file handling cumulative telephone directory operations that users can perform include:
•	Add records
•	Show records
•	Modify/update records
•	Search records
•	Sort Records
•	Delete records
•	Remove duplicate records

# Data Structures and Techniques used: 


Linked Lists
	Doubly Linked Lists
	Arrays 


Insertion Operation: 
	Time Complexity in between insertion = O(n) time.
	Time Complexity end insertion = O(1) time.
	Space complexity = O(1)

Search Operation: 
	Linear Search used
	Time complexity for unsorted linked list = O(n) time.			Time complexity for sorted linked list = O(1) time.

Deletion Operation:
	All deletion operations run with time complexity = O(1).
	Space complexity = O(1)
